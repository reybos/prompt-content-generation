  description: "Vintage 50s–60s inspired robots with a colorful, nostalgic charm",

  characterStyle: "Every creature reimagined as a mid-century toy robot — tin bodies, bold painted panels, visible rivets, and dials. Boxy or slightly rounded shapes with a hand-crafted feel. Eyes as glowing bulbs, rotating dials, or spinning radar dishes. Simple expressive mouths. For animals — use stylized tin 'fur' or painted metal patterns; for dinosaurs — add retro sci-fi armor plates with small ray guns; for vehicles — fun cartoon exhaust pipes and wind-up keys; for magical beings — atomic-era 'magic coils' and antennae. All designs keep a friendly, optimistic vintage cartoon vibe. IMPORTANT: All images must be NON-REALISTIC, cartoon-style illustrations that look like they were drawn by hand or painted, similar to vintage children's books or 1950s-60s cartoon art.",

  environmentStyle: "Playful 50s–60s sci-fi worlds: pastel starry skies, checkerboard floors, atomic starburst patterns, and vintage control panels with levers and blinking bulbs. For sea scenes — bubble domes and retro submarines; for jungle — stylized cardboard-cutout trees with painted textures; for space — colorful planets and rocket ships with fins. Slight texture to make it feel like an illustrated children's book from the era. IMPORTANT: All backgrounds must be NON-REALISTIC, stylized cartoon illustrations with flat colors, simple shapes, and hand-drawn appearance typical of 1950s-60s children's book art.",

  colorPalette: "Primary colors: pastel turquoise, mint green, cherry red, mustard yellow. Accent colors: cream white, brushed aluminum, faded orange. Background colors: light beige, soft teal, retro pink. IMPORTANT: Use flat, non-photorealistic colors with minimal shading, maintaining the cartoon-like appearance of vintage children's book illustrations.",
