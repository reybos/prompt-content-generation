    description: "Bright, high-tech futuristic robot style for all types of characters",
  
    characterStyle: "All creatures are redesigned as friendly robots while keeping their recognizable shape and personality. Smooth polished metal or chrome surfaces with glowing accents. Rounded forms for a friendly, huggable feel. Eyes replaced with expressive LED panels, holographic shapes, or glowing lenses. Small animated details like rotating antennae, light strips, or micro-hover units. For animals — robotic fur or feathers made from flexible metallic fibers; for dinosaurs — armor plates with built-in lights; for vehicles — sleek panels and energy thrusters; for magical beings — glowing runes and floating energy orbs integrated into the body. All designs must look playful and safe, without sharp dangerous shapes.",
  
    environmentStyle: "Vivid futuristic backdrops tailored to the character type: neon jungle for wild animals, glowing coral reefs for sea creatures, cyber cityscapes for vehicles, cosmic nebula for space beings, and floating crystal gardens for magical robots. Backgrounds have soft depth-of-field blur to keep focus on the character. Additional elements like floating drones, holograms, and light trails create a lively, dynamic world.",
  
    colorPalette: "Primary colors: chrome silver, glossy white, pearl grey. Accent colors: neon blue, electric pink, lime green, and glowing purple. Background colors: gradient skies from deep navy to magenta, luminous cyan water, or emerald-tinted forests."
